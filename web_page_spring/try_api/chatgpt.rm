I want to add Chatgpt to our project as part of our website. 
Recently, Chatgpt was about to open its API function, 
which means we can call Chatgpt from anywhere. 
Chatgpt will change our society significantly. In our project, 
Chatgpt can solve all kinds of minor problems for students, 
and it can also serve as our intelligent customer service to coordinate students to solve real problems. 
And it can also make the whole project more dynamic and increase the community's activity.
I dont know how to use the api key for chatgot, beecause if chatgpt detect i share this api key to public, they will change the api key.
