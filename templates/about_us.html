            <h3>Our Goals</h3>
        <p>Welcome to our project finder web page for college students! Our aim is to provide a centralized platform for students to discover and apply for research opportunities in their areas of interest. We understand that finding research projects can be a time-consuming and challenging process, especially for college students who are new to the research world or have limited connections in their field of study. Our project finder web page is designed to streamline this process and help students find research opportunities that align with their academic and career goals.</p >

            <h3>Opportunities</h3>
            <p>Our web page offers a user-friendly interface that enables students to search for projects by specifying the research area, academic level, project duration, and other relevant criteria. In addition, we provide detailed information about each project, including the research topic, project description, required skills, and contact information for the faculty member leading the project. Students can easily create a profile, save their favorite projects, and apply for projects directly through the platform.</p >
